"""
Estimated Testnet Beta Release: March 2022 (v0.1.0)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Urgent Tasks:
    - We need to establish a peer to peer framework
    - Work on consensus.py and make the Enchanted Consensus Weighted and then add that logic to the is_valid_transaction() function in graph.py.

Not Urgent Tasks:
    - There's a small chance only two transactions will appear, probably due to an error appending the transaction to the ledger.
    - Focus on recruiting developers, this time search up open-sourced developers or open-source blockchain developers.
    - Add your JIT Compiler throughout the code

Ideas:
    - Copy Nano where everyone has their own ledger.

Bugs:
    - There's a small chance only two transactions will appear, probably due to an error appending the transaction to the ledger.
