"""
Estimated Testnet Beta Release: March 2022 (v0.1.0)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What we need to implement for the Testnet Beta Release:
1. People should be able to join the network with their IPs and ports.
2. People can send and receive JSON files to each other.

I might want to simplify the requirements.txt

Also, we need to prevent users from using my wallet and my passphrase as well
